# Gasless NFT Bulk Minting

This project demonstrates a method for bulk minting NFTs without requiring the user to pay gas fees. It leverages [Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/) for facilitating meta transactions, allowing users to mint multiple NFTs in a single action seamlessly.

## Key Features

- **Bulk Minting Capability**: Enables minting multiple NFTs at once, improving efficiency.
- **Gasless Transactions**: Utilizes meta transactions to eliminate gas fees for the user, making the NFT minting process more accessible.
- **Biconomy Integration**: Simplifies blockchain transactions by managing gas fees on behalf of users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.
- An Ethereum wallet with some testnet ETH (for deploying contracts).
- An Alchemy account for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EthanHuntIMF99/Gasless.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Gasless
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the variables with your Alchemy API key, wallet private key, etc.

### Deployment

Deploy your smart contracts to a testnet (e.g., Sepolia):

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

## Usage

Refer to the project's documentation for instructions on using the system to mint NFTs gaslessly.
